## Additional resources / Prior Art

<!--

Note on this section:

* Use full URLs for issues and merge requests/patches, even if they are within GitLab SaaS, since
  we don't sync them between platforms to limit API ratelimiting.
* If none, just write Not Applicable here. If you add now (or later by editing), use bullet points
  list one link per point.
