## How to mention the crew?

> **Note**: These also apply to anyone outside Recap Time Squad.

* Remember that tagging `@recaptime-dev/squad` will trigger email notifications to ALL users under the subgroup, which might overwelm things on the backend easily.[^1] We recommend directly mentioning the individual members themselves (or the ).
* Only tag everyone in case of:
  * emergency async meetings, especially as required by @RecapTime/legal team.
  * important org-wide announcements that might affect the operations of the organization
* For GitHub users, simply ping the @RecapTimeSquad admin account.
