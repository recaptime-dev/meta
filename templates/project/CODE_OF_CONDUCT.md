# RecapTime.dev Community Code of Conduct

This project adopts the **Recap Time Squad Community Code of Conduct** (based off the
[Contributor Convenant v2.1]) in making a inclusive and productive space for the
community.

Project and community spaces within Recap Time Squad, including those within the
Hack Club Slack and its own spaces where our team members are also participating, also adopted the
[Hack Club Code of Conduct] but do note that you should contact the project maintainers
and our team first in case of emergencies before esclating to the Fire Department in HC Slack.
