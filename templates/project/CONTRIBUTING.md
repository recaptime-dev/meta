# Contributing guidelines for meta repo

## Prerequisites

### Linux DCO / CLA

By contributing patches, you agree to the [Linux DCO] and sign-off your commits by adding
a `Singed-off-by` trailer on your commit message via `git commit --signoff`.

**For community contributors**: We do not require to sign our CLA in most projects (like this),
although if we adopt the Apache CLA (instead of rolling our own via Canonical's
[Project Harmony]), we'll assume your CLA signature will make your agreement to DCO legally
binding.
