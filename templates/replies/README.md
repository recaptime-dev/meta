# Reply templates for maintainers

Here is a list of common **reply messages** shared by core team members to help them respond to issues. Some of them are adopted from [OpenCollective's meta issue tracker](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/tree/main/.github/MAINTAINER_REPLY_TEMPLATES).

You can add those to your [GitHub saved replies settings](https://github.com/settings/replies).

- [Guidelines are not followed](guidelines-not-followed.md)
- [Use Matrix/Discord/public inbox](do-not-use-issue-tracker-for-support.md)
- [Don't comment on a closed issue](commented-on-closed-issues.md)
