# Andrei Jiroh Halili (~ajhalili2006)

Self-appointed benevolent dictator for life (SABDFL) and open-source maintainer, also Engineering and Open-source Department lead. Sometimes open-source contributor to projects outside ours.

## Bio

I was born in the Philippines and currently finishing senior high school as of time of writing. I founded Recap Time Squad formerly under The Pins Team in the past years before settled into Recap Time Squad.

I'm also neurodivergent/disabled, specifically autistic (through an official diagnosis at a early age), so please apologize for limited availability (due to autistic burnout and mental health reasons).

## Schedule

My timezone is GMT+8, specifically Philippine Standard Time. Mostly works at night from 21:00 to 01:30 outside regular school year calendar, although it depends.
