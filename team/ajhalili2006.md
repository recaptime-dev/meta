## Bio / In their own words

I am the lead open-source developer/maintainer here at Recap Time Squad from the Philippines, which I usually
refer to myself as a squad lead[^1] since 2018 under numerous names before I settled on the current name during
the pandemic. I am mostly the TypeScript guy here in both Node.js and Deno, hence been working on the backends
(especially API stuff and CLI apps (because I love back(end) pain). I'm disabled and/or neurodivergent[^2],
specifically as an early-diagnosed autist (often high-masking in real life), so please apologize for limited
availability, mainly on hauling over autistic burnout while balancing school and personal life.

Other than being an open-sourcerer here, I am also a writer primarily for [my blog](https://blog.andreijiroh.dev),
a [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/user/ajhalili2006) editor and a multifandom goober (I mean part of
multiple fandoms).

## Legal/Financial Disclosures

Other than being disabled/neurodivergent myself, I have some to disclose, legally speaking:

- I am a crypto native, although I only hold small amounts of crypto (both in custodian and non-custodian wallets)
and mostly spent on catching up with the news and exploring the crypto market and community.
- I have been a Hack Clubber since Arcade (July 2024) and officially became part of the Alumni Society after my
senior high school graduation, but not part of the HQ or the HCB team. It happened that I chose Hack Club as our
fiscal host due to [their in-house tooling][hcb-repo], similar to Open Collective.

## Socials

I am mostly found active over at [the fediverse via `@ajhalili2006@tilde.zone`][fediverse]
([also on `verified.social`][verified.social] and [Hackstodon]) and [Bluesky], with varying degrees
of activity at [Substack](https://substack.com/@ajhalili2006), [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com/ajhalili2006),
and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ajhalili2006) / [Threads](https://threads.net/@ajhalili2006).

You can find all the links and more at <https://links.andreijiroh.dev> (also on [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/ajhalili2006).

[^1]: For the technically inclined, I am considered a [SABDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth) or a project leader depending on the Linux distribution you are using (either Ubuntu or Arch if you will). I may rename that from "squad lead" once Recap Time Squad is no longer a one-man operation.
[^2]: Personally, I do not use the term "superpower" to describe my autism diagnosis, and being disabled and neurodivergent are not mutually exclusive.
